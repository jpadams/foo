# foo

This module provides an example of a custom Puppet function similar to the loadyaml() function of http://forge.puppetlabs.com/puppetlabs/stdlib

It is easy to write you own custom functions: https://docs.puppetlabs.com/guides/custom_functions.html

To use this example, simply clone the module's git repo to your modulepath and then run:

```
# puppet apply -e "include foo"
```
